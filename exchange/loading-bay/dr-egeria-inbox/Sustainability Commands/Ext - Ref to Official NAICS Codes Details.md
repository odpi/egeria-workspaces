The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) is the standard used by Federal statistical agencies in classifying business establishments for the purpose of collecting, analyzing, and publishing statistical data related to the U.S. business economy.

It is a hierarchical set of codes that goes into finer granularity and is updated more often when compared to similar kinds of codes defined by the UN and other organizations. 

NAICS classifications are updated every five years. These codes are used in a variety of contexts, including as a basis for understanding carbon emissions in different kinds of industries.

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) is the standard used by Federal statistical agencies in classifying business establishments for the purpose of collecting, analyzing, and publishing statistical data related to the U.S. business economy.

NAICS was developed under the auspices of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), and adopted in 1997 to replace the [Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) system](http://www.osha.gov/pls/imis/sic_manual.html). It was developed jointly by the U.S. Economic Classification Policy Committee (ECPC), [Statistics Canada](https://www.statcan.gc.ca/eng/concepts/index), and Mexico's [Instituto Nacional de Estadistica y Geografia](http://www.inegi.org.mx/), to allow for a high level of comparability in business statistics among the North American countries.

This official U.S. Government Web site provides the latest information on plans for NAICS revisions, as well as access to various NAICS reference files and tools. Additional information on the background and development of NAICS is available in the History section of this Web site.
