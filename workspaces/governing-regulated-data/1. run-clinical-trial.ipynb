    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Clinical trials are used to test that new treatments are both safe and effective.  They involve taking measurements from various patients both before and after they start the treatment.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data comes in from a variety of hospitals.  It is personally sensitive to the patients, of importance to the business, and subject to regulatory control and so care is needed that:\n",
    "\n",
    "* it has been collected correctly\n",
    "* it is protected at all times\n",
    "* the correct data sharing agreements are in place to provide legal cover, both for the hospitals and Coco Pharmaceuticals.\n",
    "\n",
    "We look at this process from the perspective of\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The **business (clinical research)** who manage the clinical trial.  Tessa Tube is Coco Pharmaceutical's Chief Research Officer. She commissions any new trial, sets out the requirements and objectives for the study.  Tanya Tidie is responsible for the administration of the clinical trial.  She organizaes the data sharing agreements with the hospitals and monitors the progress to ensure all of the evidence is in place to show to the regulators.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. The **data engineer** who sets up the data pipelines. Peter Profile is responsible for selecting the Unity Catalog that will protect the data from the clinical trial, setting up a schema and volume for the weekly measurements data in that catalog and, as the hospitals complete their registration into the clinical trail, activate the landing area and onboarding pipeline for data fro mthe hospital.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The **data scientist** who analyses the resulting data.  Callie Quartile is the data scientist who has to locate, access and analyse the data.  She needs to be sure the data is of sufficient quality and she has the right permissions to perform the type of analysis she wants.\n",

    "Solution blueprint definitions are created through a simple markdown document that is loaded into Egeria using the Dr.Egeria feature.  It is a generic description of how a particular type of project (clinical trials in this example) operate.  A solution blueprint contains a description of the people (or more specifically the roles of the people) involved in this type of project along with both the manual and automated processes in use. It provides a convenient structure for linking descriptions of the governance requirements and responsibilities into a business operational view.  Thus the solution blueprint consolidates the aspects of an activity that the organisation wishes to be consistent.  This may be for cost, or quality and/or regulatory reasons.\n",

    "If we start from the top, there is data coming in from one or more hospitals, and each hospital has a coordinator that ensures the hospital is delivering the data as agreed.  We don’t really know exactly how each hospital manages their data - just that whatever processes they have, will deliver the appropriate data into the landing area folder for the hospital.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The delivery of data from a hospital is immediately detected by the landing folder cataloguer which initiates an onboarding request for the data.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The onboarding pipeline is responsible for moving the data to the safety of the data lake and ensuring it is correctly catalogued.  This is a critical step, and it is set up and managed by a data engineer, who is supported by the clinical trial manager if there are issues with the data from any of the hospitals.  Once  the data is in the data lake, it is picked up by the clinical trials researchers and data scientists for analysis and ultimately to deliver a report summarising the findings of the clinical trial.\n",
