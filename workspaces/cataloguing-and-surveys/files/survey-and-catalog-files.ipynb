    "# Cataloguing and surveying files\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This workbook explains how to survey and catalog files in a file system.  Files are used for many purposes in data management.  A single file may contain an entire database with many tables and columns, or it may represent a single row of data in a table.  The contents themselves may be encoded in different formats.  The result is a large variation in the business value of a file-full of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Egeria's file system survey service helps to identify where the most valuable files are located in your file systems.  It produces a report that shows the types of files that you have, classified in multiple ways, their size and an assessment of which files have been read, updated and deleted recently.\n",
    "\n",
    "Egeria's file system catalog service creates [asset](https://egeria-project.org/concepts/asset/) entries in open metadata, making it possible for data professionals to search for and locate files for their projects.  The catalog service works independently to the survey service.  It also captures the same information about each file as the survey service.  So if you want to catalog all files, you can use the catalog service without using the survey service first.  However, if you suspect that many files are of no interest to your data professionals, the information from the survey service can be used to configure the catalog service to ensure only potentially interesting files are catalogued.\n",
    "\n",
    "The file system catalog service is able to catalog:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The files in a specific directory (folder)\n",
    "* The subdirectories nested under a specific directory\n",
    "* The files and folders nested under a specific directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once a file is catalogued in open metadata, it is possible, for certain types of files, to survey their contents.\n",
    "\n",
    "This workbook uses Egeria's python libaries called *pyegeria* to activate different types of surveys and cataloguing, and then to view the results.  The code below activates pyegeria.\n",
