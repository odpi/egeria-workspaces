# Overview
This directory contains a sample Docker Compose script to support the deployment of MLFlow for experimentation,
development, and learning. [mlflow](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/ml/) is an open source tool for managing the Machine
Learning lifecycle. We are experimenting with using this with Egeria.



As always, your feedback and participation are welcome.
