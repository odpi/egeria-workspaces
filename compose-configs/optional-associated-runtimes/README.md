# Overview
This directory contains sample Docker Compose scripts for companion runtimes that can be used with Egeria. They are provided for
convenient, supporting experimentation, development, and learning. 
Currently there are compose configurations for:

    * Airflow & Marquez - used for demonstrating Open Lineage and other metadata integrations.
    * Milvus - a vector database used in AI workloads.
    * Superset—an analytics and reporting dashboard that we use to present Egeria survey results.
    * Unity Catalog—The Open Source version of Unity Catalog—we use for demonstrating Egeria's integration with other catalogs.
 

As always, your feedback and participation are welcome.
