# Pyegeria Web Handler
The Pyegeria Web Handler is a python module that provides a web handler for the pyegeria command line interface. It is
used to execute Dr.Egeria commands from anything that can make a REST call - and that shares the same filesystem as
the Egeria runtime.

## Maintenance Notes
The Pyegeria Web Handler now uses the **Dr. Egeria v2** core, which features a dynamic registry-based dispatcher (`V2Dispatcher`).

### Dynamic Discovery
Unlike previous versions, you no longer need to manually update `dr_egeria_md.py` with `if-elif` blocks when new commands are added to `pyegeria`. The handler now:
1.  **Auto-Registers**: Scans command specifications (JSON) in `md_processing/data/compact_commands` and automatically maps them to their respective processors.
2.  **Supports Variants**: Handles "Link", "Attach", "Add", "Detach", "Remove", etc., automatically based on the command specs.
3.  **Hot Reload**: You can trigger a refresh of the command specifications (without restarting the container) via the `/dr-egeria/refresh` POST endpoint or the "Refresh" button in the Obsidian plugin.

### Diagnostics
The v2 engine provides rich feedback tables ("Command Analysis" and "Parsed Attributes"). If the Obsidian plugin detects a long response, it will display these diagnostics in a modal window to help troubleshoot markdown formatting or missing requirements.

### Path Handling
The Dr. Egeria engine and the Obsidian plugin work together to ensure that input paths are correctly resolved, even in "Content-First" mode:
- The Obsidian plugin allows configuring a **Vault Root** (the path inside the container) and an **Input Path** (the subfolder in the vault).
- These are combined with the note name to create a logical `input_file` path sent to the backend.
- The MCP server uses this logical path for context (like naming output files) but processes the actual markdown content from a temporary file created in the container's inbox. 
- This ensures that notes can be processed even if the Obsidian vault is not mounted into the Docker container.

### Generalized MCP
The included `mcp_server.py` now supports dynamic execution. You can use the `egeria_execute_command` tool to run any Dr. Egeria command by name, and `egeria_list_commands` to see what is currently available.

## Model Context Protocol (MCP) Support

### Overview
The PyegeriaWebHandler includes a built-in MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that exposes Dr. Egeria capabilities through the MCP standard. This allows AI assistants like Claude to interact with your Egeria metadata ecosystem through a standardized protocol.

### MCP Protocol Support
The PyegeriaWebHandler uses the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** standard via the `mcp` Python library. The implementation is highly flexible, supporting:
- **Transport Protocols**: 
  - **SSE (over HTTP)**: Used by the "Calling the Dr." Obsidian plugin (host port 8800/sse, or 8885/sse via Apache).
  - **stdio**: Used by local command-line tools and Claude Desktop.
- **Server Framework**: `FastMCP` from the `mcp` library for simplified server implementation.
- **Content-First Architecture**: In SSE mode, the server returns the generated Markdown content directly to the client, which then handles the file writing. This eliminates permission issues and path-mapping complexity.
- **Tool-Based Interface**: All Dr. Egeria commands are exposed as MCP "tools" that can be discovered and called by any MCP client.

### Configuration

#### Option 1: Using the Docker Container
The MCP server runs automatically inside the `pyegeria-web` container when started. However, the primary entry point in the container is the FastAPI server (port 8000), which is the web-based handler for Dr. Egeria commands.

To access the MCP server directly from the container, you would need to:
1. Connect to the container
2. Execute the `mcp_server.py` script directly (this is useful for MCP-based clients)

#### Option 2: Local Development / Direct Access
If you want to run the MCP server locally on your machine (e.g., for Claude Desktop integration):

**Environment Variables:**
```bash
export EGERIA_USER="erinoverview"
export EGERIA_USER_PASSWORD="secret"
export EGERIA_ROOT_PATH="/Users/<you>/localGit/egeria-v6/egeria-workspaces-fs/exchange-quickstart"
export EGERIA_INBOX_PATH="loading-bay/dr-egeria-inbox"
export EGERIA_OUTBOX_PATH="distribution-hub/dr-egeria-outbox"
export PYEGERIA_LOG_DIRECTORY="/Users/<you>/localGit/egeria-v6/egeria-workspaces-fs/compose-configs/egeria-quickstart/PyegeriaWebHandler/logs"
```

If you launch `mcp_server.py` from within this workspace and do not set these values explicitly, the server will now auto-detect the quickstart exchange tree and use a writable local log directory.

**Running the MCP Server:**
```bash
python mcp_server.py
```

#### Option 3: Claude Desktop Integration
To integrate with Claude Desktop, configure your `claude_desktop_config.json`.
The key under `mcpServers` is a client-side alias, not a protocol-mandated server name. For the Dr. Egeria MCP server, use a distinct alias such as `dr-egeria` so it can coexist with the separate `pyegeria` MCP server in the same config:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "dr-egeria": {
      "command": "/path/to/python",
      "args": ["/path/to/mcp_server.py"],
      "env": {
        "EGERIA_USER": "erinoverview",
        "EGERIA_USER_PASSWORD": "secret",
        "EGERIA_VIEW_SERVER": "qs-view-server",
        "EGERIA_VIEW_SERVER_URL": "https://localhost:9443",
        "EGERIA_ROOT_PATH": "/Users/<you>/localGit/egeria-v6/egeria-workspaces-fs/exchange-quickstart",
        "EGERIA_INBOX_PATH": "loading-bay/dr-egeria-inbox",
        "EGERIA_OUTBOX_PATH": "distribution-hub/dr-egeria-outbox",
        "PYEGERIA_LOG_DIRECTORY": "/Users/<you>/localGit/egeria-v6/egeria-workspaces-fs/compose-configs/egeria-quickstart/PyegeriaWebHandler/logs"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Available MCP Tools

The MCP server exposes the following tools:

- **`dr_egeria_run_block`** (Main Tool - Direct Dr. Egeria Commands)
   - Execute any Dr. Egeria markdown command block. 
   - **Content-First Processing**: The server saves the `markdown_block` to a temporary file in the container, allowing it to process content from remote clients (like Obsidian) without requiring local file access.
   - **Output Note**: In SSE mode, this tool returns the generated Markdown as a string.
   - Parameters:
     - `markdown_block`: Markdown content with H1 command blocks
     - `url`: Egeria platform URL (e.g., `https://host.docker.internal:9443`)
     - `server_name`: Egeria view server name (e.g., `qs-view-server`)
     - `user_id`: Egeria user ID
     - `user_pass`: Egeria user password
     - `directive`: `display`, `validate`, or `process` (default: `process`)

2. **`egeria_execute_command`** (Convenience Wrapper)
   - Execute any Dr. Egeria command by name instead of writing markdown
   - Parameters: `command_name`, `attributes`, `url`, `server_name`, `user_id`, `user_pass`, `directive`
   - This is a wrapper around `dr_egeria_run_block` that constructs the markdown for you

3. **`egeria_list_commands`** (Discovery Tool)
   - List all available Dr. Egeria commands
   - Parameters: none
   - Shows the 108+ available commands (Create, Link, View, Attach, etc.)

4. **`egeria_refresh_specs`** (Maintenance Tool)
   - Refresh command specifications from JSON files
   - Parameters: none
   - Useful when new commands are added without restarting the server

5. **`egeria_list_glossaries`** & **`egeria_list_collections`** (Convenience Shortcuts)
   - Quick access to common Egeria operations
   - Parameters: `url`, `server_name`, `user_id`, `user_pass`
   - **Important**: These ARE convenience shortcuts, NOT standalone Dr. Egeria commands. They require the same connection parameters as `dr_egeria_run_block` because they call it internally with a "View Glossaries" or "View Collections" markdown block.

#### Understanding the Tool Types

**Dr. Egeria Commands** (108+ available via `egeria_execute_command` or `dr_egeria_run_block`):
- Create Glossary, Create Glossary Term, Create Collection, Create Data Class, Create Governance Policy, etc.
- Link Term To Data Field, Link Data to Governance, etc.
- View Report, Set Glossary as Taxonomy, Attach Data Value Specification, etc.

**MCP Tool Wrappers** (provided by the server for convenience):
- `egeria_list_glossaries` — calls `dr_egeria_run_block` with "View Glossaries" command
- `egeria_list_collections` — calls `dr_egeria_run_block` with "View Collections" command
- `egeria_execute_command` — constructs markdown and calls `dr_egeria_run_block`

**Why the convenience wrappers might fail**:
- They still require connection parameters (`url`, `server_name`, `user_id`, `user_pass`)
- If Claude doesn't pass these parameters, the tool call will fail
- You need to tell Claude: "List glossaries from our Egeria instance at https://localhost:9443 with server qs-view-server"

### Does MCP Support Interfere with Pyegeria's MCP Server?

**Short Answer: No, there is no interference.**

**Detailed Explanation:**
- The `mcpServers` entry name is just a unique alias in the client config. It does not need to match the Python module name or the internal `FastMCP(...)` server name.
- The PyegeriaWebHandler's MCP server (`mcp_server.py`) is a **separate, independent process** from the FastAPI web server
- The pyegeria package may have its own MCP server implementation, but they operate in completely different contexts:
  - **PyegeriaWebHandler MCP**: Designed to expose Dr. Egeria markdown commands through MCP to external MCP clients (like Claude Desktop)
  - **Pyegeria Package MCP** (if present): Likely designed for a different use case or integration pattern
- Both can coexist and run simultaneously without conflicts
- A practical convention is to keep the pyegeria package server as `pyegeria` and name this server `dr-egeria`.
- The PyegeriaWebHandler's MCP server communicates directly with the filesystem (reading from `dr-egeria-inbox`, writing to `dr-egeria-outbox`) and the Egeria platform via REST APIs
- No shared resources or port conflicts occur if they are run in separate processes

### Use Cases

1. **AI-Assisted Metadata Management**: Use Claude Desktop with the MCP integration to manage your Egeria metadata through conversational AI
2. **Automated Governance Workflows**: Script MCP tool calls to automate metadata governance operations
3. **Integration with Other Tools**: Connect any MCP-compatible tool to your Egeria ecosystem
4. **Local Development**: Test Dr. Egeria commands locally before deploying to Docker

## Examples

### Using the Dr. Egeria MCP Server in Claude Desktop

Once you've configured the `dr-egeria` server in Claude Desktop, you can ask Claude to perform Dr. Egeria operations directly:

**Example conversation:**
```
User: "Create a glossary called 'Data Dictionary' in our Egeria instance"

Claude: I'll create a glossary for you using the Dr. Egeria MCP server.
[Claude calls dr_egeria_run_block with the command]

Output: Glossary 'Data Dictionary' created successfully with ID: glossary-12345
```

**Behind the scenes**, Claude uses the `dr_egeria_run_block` tool with:
- A markdown block containing: `# Create Glossary\n## Glossary Name\nData Dictionary`
- Your platform URL and view server
- Your credentials

### Using the Pyegeria MCP Server in Claude Desktop

The `pyegeria` server provides direct access to the Python pyegeria library:

**Example conversation:**
```
User: "List all metadata stores in our Egeria instance"

Claude: I'll query the available metadata stores using the pyegeria MCP server.
[Claude calls appropriate pyegeria tool]

Output: Available metadata stores:
- qs-metadata-store (primary)
- qs-archive-store (archive)
```

### Comparison: When to Use Each Server

| Task | Dr. Egeria MCP | Pyegeria MCP |
|------|---|---|
| Create/Update metadata via markdown commands | ✓ | - |
| View glossaries and collections | ✓ | ✓ |
| Advanced metadata queries | - | ✓ |
| Governance workflows | ✓ | ✓ |
| Integration with AI assistants | ✓ | ✓ |

### Example: Multi-Step Workflow

Using both servers together in a single Claude conversation:

```
User: "Create a new glossary called 'Financial Terms' and then show me all 
       the glossaries currently defined"

Claude: I'll do this in two steps.

Step 1: Create the glossary using Dr. Egeria commands
[calls dr_egeria_run_block]
→ Created glossary 'Financial Terms'

Step 2: List all glossaries using Dr. Egeria
[calls egeria_list_glossaries]
→ Available glossaries:
  - Data Dictionary (glossary-12345)
  - Financial Terms (glossary-12346)
  - Business Concepts (glossary-12347)
```

### Calling Convenience Tools Correctly

The convenience tools (`egeria_list_glossaries`, `egeria_list_collections`, etc.) require connection parameters. Here's the correct way to ask Claude to use them:

**Example - Listing glossaries:**
```
User: "List all the glossaries in our Egeria instance at https://localhost:9443 
       using the Dr. Egeria MCP server with server name qs-view-server"

Claude: I'll list the glossaries using the egeria_list_glossaries tool.
[Calls egeria_list_glossaries with url, server_name, user_id, user_pass]

Output: Available glossaries:
• Data Assets (id: glossary-001)
• Product Catalog (id: glossary-002)
• Business Concepts (id: glossary-003)
```

**Why this matters**: The convenience tools are wrappers around `dr_egeria_run_block`. They need your connection details to work:
- `url`: Your Egeria platform URL
- `server_name`: Your view server name (e.g., `qs-view-server`)
- `user_id`: Your Egeria username
- `user_pass`: Your Egeria password

## Egeria Explorer

The PyegeriaWebHandler includes a built-in **Egeria Explorer** — an interactive browser for the live Egeria metadata ecosystem. It is a single-page application, all read-only, all backed by live Egeria API calls. Tabs are grouped into three nav groups in the header bar: **Type System** (Type Explorer, Valid Values, REST APIs, Python API), **Review** (Glossary, Reference Data, Data Design, Solution Architect, Supply Chains, Actors, Perspectives, Governance Definitions, Projects), and **Act** (Digital Products, Report Specs, Dr. Egeria). Many sections include a **TimeSlider** ("As of date") for point-in-time browsing.

![Egeria Explorer — Glossary tab](../../../../docs/images/Glossary.png)

![Egeria Explorer — Type Explorer tab](../../../../docs/images/Type%20Explorer.png)

### Accessing the Explorer

Once the stack is running, open a browser and navigate to:

```
http://localhost:8885/egeria-explorer
```

The alias `/type-explorer` is also supported and serves the same application:

```
http://localhost:8885/type-explorer
```

Apache proxies both URLs through to the `pyegeria-web` container, which serves the single-page application and its backing API.

### Sections

The explorer opens to a **Home** splash screen on first load. Tabs are grouped into three drop-down nav groups (plus the **⌂ Home** tab always visible at the left): **Type System**, **Review**, and **Act**. Each tab is independent; data is loaded lazily when the tab is first opened. All sections are read-only.

#### Home (Splash Screen)

The initial view shown when the application loads. It presents a one-paragraph description of the tool and a card for each of the seven capabilities. Each card shows an icon, title, and short description of what that section does. Clicking **Open →** on any card navigates directly to that section. The **⌂ Home** tab in the header returns to this screen from any section.

No Egeria connection or data fetch is required to display the splash screen.

#### Type System

Browses the Egeria open metadata type system fetched live from `ValidMetadataManager`.

Two sub-views:

**Type Explorer** — Left sidebar with three collapsible sections (Entity Types, Classifications, Relationships). A search box filters all three simultaneously. The right panel shows:
- **Properties tab** — all own and inherited properties, with `own`/`req`/`deprecated` badges and a toggle to hide inherited properties.
- **Relationships tab** — every relationship the type participates in, derived by walking the full supertype chain.
- **Graph tab** — SVG inheritance diagram showing ancestors above and direct subtypes below. Nodes are clickable to navigate.

A dropdown in the header filters entity types to a specific area (0 = Foundation through 7 = Lineage). Relationship and classification types are always shown in full regardless of the area filter.

**Attribute Index** — Searchable cross-reference of every property name to every type that declares it. Useful for answering "which types have a `description` field?" Clicking a type name navigates to it in the Type Explorer.

#### Reference Data

Browses Egeria's valid value sets and values. Displays as an expandable tree: root-level `ValidValueSet` (and `ReferenceDataSet`) nodes expand to show their member values and any nested child sets.

- Click a set to see its description, qualified name, and usage.
- Click a value to see its preferred value, category, data type, scope, and deprecation status.
- The filter box narrows visible tree nodes by display name.
- Click the **▦ Load Context Diagram** button to fetch and render a Mermaid context diagram for any selected element.

#### Digital Products

Browses the digital product catalog hierarchy: Catalogs → Families → Products. Each level is a `Collection` subtype in Egeria.

- Select a catalog from the left panel to load its full tree.
- The tree uses expand/collapse twisties. Containers are sorted above leaf products.
- The detail panel shows all `DigitalProductProperties` fields (maturity, version, dates, deployment status).
- Glossary-linked products show a **View in Glossary →** button that navigates to the Glossary tab for that element.
- Click **▦ Load Context Diagram** on any element to render its Mermaid context diagram.

#### Glossary

Browses glossaries, folders, and terms.

- **TimeSlider** ("As of date") at the top of the glossary sidebar lets you browse the glossary as it existed at any past point in time. Moving the slider re-fetches the glossary list, folder tree, and term search results. Lazy folder expansion also uses the selected time.
- Top panel: list of all glossaries.
- When a glossary is selected: its folders and a cross-glossary term search appear.
- Selecting a folder loads its terms in the right panel.
- Term detail shows all term properties (display name, summary, description, examples, usage, abbreviation, content status, activity status) plus folder memberships.
- **Template substitutes** — terms carrying the `TemplateSubstitute` classification are template placeholder entries, not real user-facing terms. They are hidden by default. A checkbox in the middle pane header ("Show template substitutes") reveals them; hidden ones are counted in a "N templates hidden" note. Template substitutes appear in the list with an amber `template` badge; when opened in the detail panel they are labelled **Template Substitute**. Terms copied from a template (but not themselves substitutes) show a lighter **From Template** badge.
- Click **▦ Load Context Diagram** on any term to render its diagram.

#### Report Specs

Browse pyegeria's client-side report format specifications. These are not stored in Egeria — they are Python objects in the pyegeria package describing how API responses can be formatted. No Egeria connection is needed to view this tab.

- Left panel: searchable list of all specs with perspective filter.
- Right panel: name, description, family, perspectives, output formats, and the full question spec.

#### Valid Values

Look up the registered valid values for a specific Egeria property name. Uses Egeria's controlled vocabulary registry (`get_valid_metadata_values`), which is separate from the Reference Data sets.

- Left panel: on tab open, a sidebar is pre-populated with all property names that have registered valid values (via `GET /api/valid-values/properties`). Click a name to look it up, or type any property name directly.
- Right panel: the ordered list of allowed values for the selected property, with display names, preferred values, and descriptions.

#### REST APIs

Browsable reference for the Egeria REST API surface, combining live OpenAPI discovery with a curated request body catalog.

The tab has three panels:

**Left — Service list.** OMAS/OMVS services derived from the OpenAPI spec tags (e.g., "Asset Manager OMAS", "Glossary Manager OMVS"). Click **Load API Endpoints** in the toolbar to fetch the spec from the live Egeria platform. Services are filterable by name.

**Middle — Endpoint list.** All endpoints for the selected service, each showing its HTTP method (color-coded badge), path, and summary. Filterable by path or summary text.

**Right — Detail / Body Catalog** (two inner tabs):

- *Endpoint Detail* — parameters table (path and query), the matched Layer 1 outer body type (click to jump to the Body Catalog), the inferred Layer 2 properties type name, a copyable example JSON payload assembled from the catalog, and a ready-to-run `curl` snippet.
- *Body Catalog* — the full request body catalog, always available without a live Egeria connection. Grouped into functional families (Create Entity, Update Entity, Delete Entity, Relationship, Classification, Search/Query, etc.), with every field annotated and a representative example for each type.

**Two-layer payload model.** Egeria REST request bodies follow a consistent two-layer pattern:

```json
{
  "class": "NewElementRequestBody",      ← Layer 1: outer wrapper (~44 types)
  "externalSourceGUID": "...",
  "parentGUID": "...",
  "properties": {
    "class": "CollectionProperties",     ← Layer 2: type-specific properties
    "qualifiedName": "...",
    "displayName": "..."
  }
}
```

Layer 1 is a small, stable set of wrapper types defined in `egeria_request_body_catalog.json`. Layer 2 is derived from the Egeria type system — for any entity or relationship type, all properties including inherited ones are valid.

**Keeping the catalog current.** After upgrading Egeria, regenerate the catalog with:

```bash
python3 build_request_body_catalog.py /path/to/egeria-platform-X.Y/assembly/opt/http-client-collections
```

Or, if `HTTP_COLLECTIONS_PATH` is set in the environment, use the in-app endpoint:

```
POST http://localhost:8885/api/request-bodies/rebuild
```

The OpenAPI endpoint data always comes from the live platform and is cached for one hour. Force a re-fetch with:

```
POST http://localhost:8885/api/rest-apis/refresh
```

#### Solution Architect

Browses Egeria's solution architecture artefacts — blueprints and solution components.

Two sub-navigations selectable from the left sidebar header:

**Blueprints** — a list of all `SolutionBlueprint` elements. Selecting one loads its detail: display name, description, lifecycle status, qualified name, and the list of components it contains (each component linkable to the Components view). A **▦ Load Context Diagram** button is available for every blueprint.

**Components** — all `SolutionComponent` elements, independently browsable. Detail panel shows component type, version, description, and a list of implementations (linked assets or deployed capabilities). Components link back to the blueprints they belong to. Context diagrams available for each component.

#### Data Design

Browses Egeria's data design artefacts: Data Specs, Data Structures, Data Fields, Data Grains, and Data Classes.

Five sub-navigations in the left sidebar:

- **Specs** — `DataSpec` (a Collection subtype) elements representing named data requirements.
- **Structures** — `DataStructure` elements, groupings of Data Fields.
- **Fields** — `DataField` elements, individual field definitions within a structure.
- **Grains** — `DataGrain` elements, the unit of data in a Data Spec.
- **Classes** — `DataClass` elements, reusable data type classifications.

Each sub-view has a search filter and shows element cards. Selecting an element opens its detail panel with all properties plus linked related elements (e.g., the parent structure for a field, or the data class assigned to a field). Context diagrams are available for all element types.

#### Perspectives

Browses Egeria's governance perspectives — structured viewpoints used to reason about the metadata from specific stakeholder angles.

Two sub-navigations:

**Perspectives** — All `ActorProfile` elements whose type is "Perspective". Each perspective has a description and is linked to a set of Questions via `ScopedBy` relationships. The detail panel shows all linked Questions.

**Questions** — All `GlossaryTerm` elements carrying the `Question` classification. Questions represent governance concerns or decision points. Detail shows the term's summary, description, and linked Perspectives. Uses `GlossaryManager.find_glossary_terms` with `include_only_classified_elements=["Question"]` and `graph_query_depth=2` to ensure classifications are included in the response.

#### Dr. Egeria Commands

Browsable reference for all Dr. Egeria markdown command templates, plus an in-browser execution panel.

**Commands tab** — Three-column layout:

- *Left* — command families grouped by level (Basic / Advanced). Click a family to see its commands in the middle column.
- *Middle* — command list for the selected family, with title, description, and a "Create / Update" or "Link / Unlink" dual-verb badge where applicable.
- *Right* — command detail: full parameter list with required/optional status, a pre-filled markdown template, and an Execute panel.

**Execute panel** — Fills in the markdown template with values entered in the parameter fields. A **Verb** row (shown when a counterpart verb exists) lets you switch between e.g. Create and Update before running. A testing disclaimer reminds users this executes real Egeria writes. Click **Run** to POST to `/api/dr-egeria/execute` and see the result markdown inline.

No Egeria connection is required to browse command templates. Executing a command does require a running Egeria instance and valid credentials in the connection context.

#### Supply Chains

Browses Egeria's Information Supply Chain (ISC) elements.

Left sidebar lists all `InformationSupplyChain` elements with a search filter. Selecting one loads the detail panel: display name, description, scope, lifecycle status, and the full relationship graph including `InformationSupplyChainLink` segments. A **▦ Load Context Diagram** and a **▦ Load Full Graph** button are available.

#### Governance Definitions

Browses Egeria's governance definition hierarchy in a three-panel layout (all panels resizable).

**Left — Definition Types.** Tree organised into three root groups, each expanded by default:

- **Governance Drivers** (`GovernanceDriver`) — the forces that motivate governance: BusinessImperative, GovernanceStrategy, Regulation (→ RegulationArticle), Threat.
- **Governance Policies** (`GovernancePolicy`) — the intent and direction of governance: GovernanceApproach, GovernanceObligation, GovernancePrinciple.
- **Governance Controls** (`GovernanceControl`) — the mechanisms that implement governance:
  - DataLens, DataProcessingPurpose, ExceptionType, GovernanceMetric
  - GovernanceProcedure (→ Methodology), GovernanceResponsibility
  - GovernanceRule (→ NamingStandardRule), NotificationType
  - Requirement, ResearchQuestion
  - SecurityAccessControl (→ GovernanceZone, ServiceAccessControl)
  - TermsAndConditions (→ CertificationType, LicenseType, ServiceLevelObjective)

Abstract types are shown in italic. Selecting any node (abstract or concrete) loads that type's definitions in the middle panel.

**Middle — Definition List.** Definitions of the selected type, sorted alphabetically by display name. A search box filters by name (debounced 400 ms). When a parent/abstract type is selected, results include all subtypes; a small badge shows each item's concrete type. Selecting a definition loads its detail in the right panel.

**Right — Detail.** Mirrors the SolutionComponent detail style:
- Display name + typeName badge
- GUID (monospace)
- Description (Markdown-rendered)
- Mermaid context diagram (if available)
- Properties table: Qualified Name, Identifier, Scope, Usage, Domain, Importance, Status, Summary, Implications, Outcomes, Results
- All relationship groups returned by the API, with **View →** buttons for related governance definitions enabling in-tab navigation.

Uses `GovernanceOfficer.find_governance_definitions` with `metadata_element_type` kwarg for type filtering, and `get_governance_definition_by_guid` for detail.

#### Projects

Browses Egeria project metadata in two tree views and a flat list.

Three sub-navigations selectable from the left sidebar:

- **Hierarchy** — project management tree: root projects (those not managed by another) expand to show sub-projects via the `ProjectManagement` / `managedProjects` relationship.
- **Dependencies** — project dependency tree: roots are projects that nothing depends on; children are projects they depend on via the `ProjectDependency` / `dependsOnProjects` relationship.
- **All Projects** — flat alphabetical list of all projects, with status and classification badges.

Selecting a project in any view opens a detail panel showing all project properties (display name, description, status, start/planned-end dates, classifications) plus direct sub-projects.

**TimeSlider** ("As of date") at the top of the sidebar time-travels all three views. Moving the slider re-fetches the project list and rebuilds the hierarchy and dependency trees using the Egeria repository snapshot at the selected time.

#### Actors

Browses Egeria actor entities across three sub-types.

Three sub-navigations selectable from the left sidebar:

- **Profiles** — all `ActorProfile` elements (Person, Team, Organization, ITProfile). Detail shows all profile properties (display name, job title, employee number, team details) plus relationship sections (roles performed, contact details, user identities, team memberships, assignment scopes, governance zones).
- **Roles** — all `ActorRole` elements (PersonRole, GovernanceRole, SolutionActorRole, etc.). Detail shows role type, domain identifier, head count, and the actors assigned to the role.
- **Identities** — all `UserIdentity` elements. Detail shows user ID, distinguished name, and linked profiles.

All three sub-tabs load lazily and are independently searchable via their filter box. Selecting an element opens a full detail panel with relationship sections rendered as collapsible groups.

**TimeSlider** ("As of date") at the top of the sidebar time-travels all three sub-tabs simultaneously. Moving the slider resets all three sub-tab caches and re-fetches the active sub-tab at the selected time.

---

### Context diagrams (all sections)

Every detail panel in every section includes a **▦ Load Context Diagram** button. Clicking it calls `GET /api/mermaid/{guid}`, which uses `MetadataExpert.get_anchored_element_graph()` to fetch the element's Mermaid context graph from Egeria. The diagram is rendered client-side by the Mermaid JS library (v11+). If the diagram is unavailable for an element, a "No context diagram available" message is shown.

Once a diagram is loaded it can be toggled: a **Hide** button collapses it back to a compact "▦ Show Context Diagram" button without re-fetching. Clicking that button expands it again instantly (the diagram code is cached in component state).

Diagrams are loaded on demand, not pre-fetched, to avoid slowing down list and detail views.

### REST API reference

All endpoints are accessible directly in addition to being used by the SPA. Connection parameters default to environment variables (`EGERIA_PLATFORM_URL`, `EGERIA_VIEW_SERVER`, `EGERIA_USER`, `EGERIA_USER_PASSWORD`).

#### Type System

**`GET /api/types`** — All entity, relationship, and classification type definitions.

Query params: `area` (int, 0–7), `url`, `server`, `user_id`, `user_pwd`.

```
GET http://localhost:8885/api/types
GET http://localhost:8885/api/types?area=4

### Troubleshooting

**Explorer shows "Loading Egeria Explorer…" forever** — A JavaScript syntax error in `type-explorer.html` prevented React from mounting. Open the browser developer console; a `SyntaxError` will be visible. This typically means a stray straight-quote character (`"`) inside a string literal — use Unicode curly quotes (`"…"`) instead, or escape with `\`.

**`Service Unavailable` on `/egeria-explorer`** — The `pyegeria-web` container is not running. Check `docker logs quickstart-pyegeria-web` for startup errors.

**Types don't appear / partial results** — The Egeria platform may not be fully started. The `/api/types` endpoint returns a 502 if Egeria is unreachable; the SPA shows a retry button. Wait for `egeria-main` to report healthy.

**Mermaid diagrams show raw code instead of a rendered diagram** — Mermaid JS failed to load from CDN (network/proxy issue), or the CDN version is wrong. Egeria generates mermaid v11+ syntax; loading `mermaid@10` causes silent render failures. Check the `<script>` tag in `type-explorer.html` references `mermaid@11`. If the CDN is unreachable in your environment, a local copy of `mermaid.min.js` must be served instead.

**Reference Data tree shows no items** — `find_valid_value_definitions` returned no results, or all items had no `parentSets` and the root-set filter excluded them. Check that the Egeria instance has valid value definitions loaded. Items with no `parentSets` that are not themselves sets will not appear in the tree; they can still be retrieved individually via `/api/reference-data/{guid}`.

**REST API tab shows no services** — The OpenAPI spec could not be fetched. Check that the Egeria platform is running and the platform URL is correct (defaults to `EGERIA_PLATFORM_URL` env var). The `/v3/api-docs` endpoint must be reachable from the `pyegeria-web` container. The Body Catalog inner tab is always available regardless of Egeria status.

**Catalog body types look out of date after an Egeria upgrade** — Run `python3 build_request_body_catalog.py` pointing at the new version's `http-client-collections` directory, then restart the container (or call `POST /api/request-bodies/rebuild` if `HTTP_COLLECTIONS_PATH` is set).

**Glossary terms show duplicates** — The deduplication pass uses `_header(t).get("guid", "")`. If a term has an empty GUID in the response, it could slip through. Check the Egeria instance for corrupt or incomplete elements.

**Area derivation is wrong for a type** — Add the type (or one of its supertypes) to `AREA_ANCHORS` in `type_system_handler.py` with the correct area number. The container picks up the change immediately (uvicorn `--reload`).

### MCP Server Issues
- **MCP server won't start**: Ensure the `mcp` package (>= 1.15.0) is installed: `pip install 'mcp>=1.15.0'`
- **Connection refused**: Verify `EGERIA_USER`, `EGERIA_USER_PASSWORD`, and server URLs are correct
- **Commands not found**: Ensure your pyegeria version includes the command handlers in `pyegeria.view.md_processing_utils`

### FastAPI Issues
If FastAPI returns `No updates detected. New File not created.`:
- Verify the markdown block starts with a command H1 (`# <Command Name>`).
- Check `debug_log.log` for warnings like `not found in command_list` or `Unknown command`.
- Confirm your pyegeria version includes the command handler in `pyegeria.view.md_processing_utils`.

## The Catalog

The **Catalog** (`🐱` tile) is a multi-section SPA for browsing all asset types registered in Egeria, served by `tech_catalog_handler.py`. It groups assets by domain and adds Surveys & Annotations support for discovery results.

![The Catalog — Data Assets](../../../../docs/images/Data%20Assets.png)

![The Catalog — Surveys & Annotations](../../../../docs/images/Annotations.png)

### Sections

| Section | What it shows |
|---------|---------------|
| Infrastructure Assets | Servers, storage, networks, software capabilities, endpoints |
| Data Assets | Data stores, data feeds, data sets |
| APIs | Deployed APIs and endpoints |
| Processes | Software components and governance actions |
| Surveys & Annotations | Survey reports from discovery runs and their analysis annotations |
| Glossary | Glossaries, categories, and terms |
| Technology Types | Open metadata type definitions, catalog templates, governance processes |

Each section has a searchable list on the left and a detail panel on the right. The detail panel shows properties, classifications, relationships (with cross-links to other sections or Egeria Explorer), schema (if present), lineage (for asset types), and annotations (for survey reports).

Point-in-time browsing (As-Of time slider) is supported on asset sections. Resizable columns in tables, resizable list/detail split panes throughout.

---

## Egeria Audit

The **Egeria Audit** page (`🛡️` tile on the portal) is a single-page application for reviewing governance relationships and the user accounts known to the platform.

![Egeria Audit](../../../../docs/images/Audit.png) Like the Explorer it is React 18 with the application JS inlined, sharing components from `static/egeria-shared-ui.js`. It is served by `audit_handler.py`.

### Accessing the Audit page

```
http://localhost:8800/egeria-audit
```

Apache proxies the URL through to the `pyegeria-web` container. The page is also reachable from the portal's **Egeria Audit** tile.

### Tabs

Four tabs run across the top: **Exceptions · Certifications · Licenses · Users**.

- **Exceptions / Certifications / Licenses** — three views over governance relationships, all driven by the shared `AuditRelationshipTab` component backed by `ClassificationExplorer.get_relationships`. Each is a sortable, filterable table; selecting a row opens a three-section foldable detail (end1 element, relationship properties + resolved actors, end2 type). A **point-in-time TimeSlider** ("As of") threads an `asOfTime` into every fetch so you can audit the graph as it stood at an earlier moment.
- **Users** — platform user accounts for a selected OMAG Server Platform (via `RuntimeManager` + the platform's security connector). Full sort and text/status/type filter pills; admins can change a user's account status (confirmation-gated). The platform selector defaults to the last (most specific) platform in the list — the generic "Local OMAG Server Platform" typically has no users.

### Governance-zone security (why counts differ per user)

> **Important:** the relationship tabs are filtered by the **viewer's governance-zone access rights**, not by a privileged audit identity.

`get_relationships` runs as the connected user (the demo persona, or the user you connect as via the bar). The platform's metadata security connector hides any relationship whose related element sits in a governance zone that user cannot access — so **two users can legitimately see different row counts from the same query**. This is by design: the audit view respects each viewer's access rather than elevating to a super-user.

For example, in the Coco Pharmaceuticals sample the two **License** relationships attach to CSV files in the `landing-area` / `quarantine` zones, so `erinoverview`, `peterprofile` and `tanyatidie` see them while `garygeeke` and `calliequartile` see none. Exceptions, by contrast, are visible to everyone. The page surfaces this with a `🔒 filtered by your access` chip in the toolbar and an explanatory empty-state message ("No licenses are visible to you …"). If you expect rows that aren't there, connect as a steward with broader zone access.

## Egeria Operations

The **Egeria Operations** page (`🎛️` tile) monitors and operates the live Egeria runtime. Served by `operations_handler.py`, it shares the same React/`egeria-shared-ui.js` foundation as the Explorer and Audit pages.

![Egeria Operations — Servers](../../../../docs/images/Servers.png)

![Egeria Operations — Integration Connectors](../../../../docs/images/Integration%20Connectors.png)

![Egeria Operations — Engine Actions](../../../../docs/images/Engine%20Actions.png)

### Accessing the Operations page

```
http://localhost:8800/egeria-operations
```

### Tabs

Four tabs: **Servers · Integration Connectors · Governance Engines · Engine Actions**.

- **Servers** — OMAG servers reported by the platform, with status.
- **Integration Connectors** — connectors on the Integration Daemon, with status filter pills and a manual **Refresh** that triggers a connector refresh. (Note: pyegeria's sync `refresh_integration_connector` wrapper has a name bug; the handler calls the singular async method directly as a workaround.)
- **Governance Engines** — engines on the Engine Host servers, with status filter pills.
- **Engine Actions** — every engine action in the ecosystem (`AutomatedCuration.find_engine_actions`). Sortable/filterable, with **activity-status filter pills** (colour-coded: green = completed/in-progress, amber = requested/waiting, red = failed, grey = cancelled/ignored). A **Group** toggle (leftmost in the toolbar, with a ▼/▶ twistie and `☰` icon) collapses repeated instances of the same action under one row showing a colour-coded status breakdown; expanding a group preserves the active filters. Selecting an action opens a detail panel that can cross-navigate to the executor Governance Engine, or to the action itself, in The Catalog.

### Auto-refresh

Both the connector and engine views include a `RefreshControl` — a manual refresh button plus an optional interval auto-poll — so operators can watch a long-running action progress without reloading the page.
